# KULeuven Toledo Attachment Downloader (unofficial)

This is a Firefox and Chrome extension that makes it easy to download all attachments on a course page in one click.
The current version does not go into subdirectories.

## Usage
When you are on a "Course Documents" page, click on the extension icon. The extension will download all attachments,
zip them and show a download dialog for the zip file. Please wait for the dialog to appear before closing the
extension popup window, as this will stop the download.
